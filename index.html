    <h1>Everything.io</h1>
    <h2>An announcement</h2>
    <article>
      <p class="large">What I'm about to say will probably not bode well financially for my company, but it needs to be done.</p>

      <p>Everything.io is a company that makes money on things. We succeed because we appeal to your need to consume and have new products and services in your life. But we all know there is <em>more to life than money and things</em>.</p>

      <p>I started Everything for the same reasons anyone would start a business, but as its owner, I'm not a walking corporation. I'm a human who has endured hardship in my life. I've made <strong>decisions I can never take back</strong>. I've <strong>lost people</strong> who meant so much to me <strong>without really appreciating the time I had with them</strong>. I can't look back at the end of my life and see only a company that sold some stuff as my contribution to the world.</p>

      <p>So starting now and until the rest of July, <strong>we will suspend all our operations all month</strong> to make a statement about compassion.</p>

      <p>I'm asking whomever this message can reach to just stop buying, stop stressing, stop being so busy and just take 5 minutes to tell those close to you that you love them.</p>

      <p>Think of the phone call you wish you had made long ago. Have dinner with your family. Say whatever you need to say...ask for forgiveness, give appreciation, remind them how much they mean to you.</p>

      <p>While you're at it, <a href="mailto:hello@adamgrant.me">email us your stories</a> so we may post them here. Of course, maybe we'll do something special for a select few to show our appreciation. I'm hoping you can also <strong>help by sending this link around and spreading the word</strong>.</p>

      <p>With that, a parting thought from Mr. Rogers:</p>

      <p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
